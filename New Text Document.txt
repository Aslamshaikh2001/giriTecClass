 global variable-
               global variable are declared outside of function or block;
 lifetime-

               by default value of global variable is 0;

  lifetime - 
               they exist only during  execution of the function or block
declaration - 
            * local variable only  use for temporary storage;
            * by default value of local variable is garbage 
             *local variabe memory allocate after calling function   

static variable-
